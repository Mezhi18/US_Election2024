how can I angle my x-axis labels in R using axis.text.x?

ChatGPT: 
To angle the x-axis labels in R using axis.text.x, you can use the theme function in ggplot2. Here’s an example of how to set the x-axis labels to a 45-degree angle:
library(ggplot2)

# Sample plot
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
In this code:
angle = 45 rotates the labels by 45 degrees.
hjust = 1 adjusts the horizontal alignment of the labels. You may want to experiment with hjust to align the labels perfectly, especially for different angle values.
Feel free to adjust the angle to any degree you prefer. For a vertical alignment, set angle = 90.

You:
I want to keep a variable counting the number of days since the first poll with Harris as a candidate, but I want to make the x-axis labels a time series, noting the first of every month. how can I reinstate the dates using scale_x_date?

ChatGPT:
To display dates on the x-axis as a time series using scale_x_date while keeping a variable for the number of days since the first poll, you can convert your end_date_num variable to a date format by adding it to the starting date. Then, you can use scale_x_date to customize the x-axis labels.
Here's an example of how you might approach it:

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Assume `poll_data` is your dataset and `start_date` is the first date of the poll period
# Replace `poll_data` with your actual dataset name and `start_date` with your starting date

# Convert `end_date_num` to a date
poll_data <- poll_data %>%
  mutate(end_date = as.Date("YYYY-MM-DD") + end_date_num) # Replace "YYYY-MM-DD" with the actual start date

# Plot with ggplot2
ggplot(poll_data, aes(x = end_date, y = support)) + # Replace `support` with your y-axis variable
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b %Y", date_breaks = "1 month") +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Support for Harris") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
Explanation:
mutate(end_date = as.Date("YYYY-MM-DD") + end_date_num) converts end_date_num (days since the start) to an actual date, where "YYYY-MM-DD" is the start date.
scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b %Y", date_breaks = "1 month") formats the x-axis to display month and year (e.g., "Jan 2024") and adds a tick for the first of each month.
This approach gives you monthly labels, angled as needed, while keeping end_date_num in the dataset for other calculations or references.

You:
model <- cbind(num_harris, sample_size - num_harris) ~ (1 | state) + (1 | pollster) + (1 | end_date_num)

priors <- normal(0, 2.5, autoscale = TRUE)

bayesian_model <- stan_glmer(
  formula = model,
  data = harrisdata,
  family = binomial(link = "logit"),
  prior = priors,
  prior_intercept = priors,
  # weights = harrisdata$numeric_grade,
  seed = 123,
  cores = 4,
  adapt_delta = 0.95)

if I have this model, how can I plot a smooth GAM for each state individually using ggplot and the method gam?

ChatGPT: 
To plot a smooth GAM curve for each state using ggplot2 and gam, you can extract predictions from the model for each state and then use geom_smooth with method = "gam" to add a smooth curve for each state. Here’s how to set it up:

library(ggplot2)
library(mgcv) # for GAMs

# Assuming `harrisdata` contains `state`, `end_date_num`, and `num_harris` / `sample_size` columns
# Create a new variable for support percentage
harrisdata <- harrisdata %>%
  mutate(support_percent = num_harris / sample_size)

# Plotting with a GAM for each state
ggplot(harrisdata, aes(x = end_date_num, y = support_percent, color = state)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +  # Scatter plot of the data points
  geom_smooth(method = "gam", formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "cs"), se = FALSE) + # Add GAM smooth line
  labs(x = "Days Since First Poll", y = "Support for Harris (%)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  facet_wrap(~ state)  # Creates a separate panel for each state
Explanation
support_percent: We create this new variable to plot the proportion of support, making it easier to interpret as a percentage.
geom_smooth(method = "gam", formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "cs"), se = FALSE): Adds a smooth GAM curve for each state with cubic splines (bs = "cs"). se = FALSE removes the confidence interval; set to TRUE if you want it displayed.
facet_wrap(~ state): Separates the plot into individual panels for each state, so each state has its own smooth line and set of data points.
This will create a panel of plots with a GAM curve for each state, allowing you to see how support trends differ across states over time.

How can I assess the accuracy of my bayesian model using modelsummary?

ChatGPT:
To assess the accuracy of your Bayesian model using modelsummary, you can use the modelsummary package to summarize key statistics and diagnostics from the model fit. For Bayesian models created with stan_glmer (from rstanarm), you can display parameter estimates, credible intervals, and some goodness-of-fit measures.
Here's how to use modelsummary with your Bayesian model:
Install and Load Required Packages:
R
Copy code
install.packages("modelsummary")
library(modelsummary)
Summarize the Model: You can use modelsummary to display the posterior mean, median, or other summary statistics along with the credible intervals of the model parameters.
R
Copy code
modelsummary(bayesian_model,
             statistic = c("mean", "sd", "conf.int"), # Mean, SD, and credible interval
             conf_level = 0.95, # Adjust confidence level if needed
             gof_omit = "AIC|BIC" # Omit criteria not available for Bayesian models
)
Additional Diagnostic Information: To add more detailed diagnostics, you can include model metrics that evaluate model fit for Bayesian models, such as loo (leave-one-out cross-validation) or waic (widely applicable information criterion), available in the rstanarm package.
R
Copy code
# Load loo package for model diagnostics
library(loo)

# Calculate loo and waic
loo_result <- loo(bayesian_model)
waic_result <- waic(bayesian_model)

# Display results
print(loo_result)
print(waic_result)
Combining Results with modelsummary: You can use modelsummary to show both parameter estimates and fit metrics by manually adding them to a custom table if needed.
R
Copy code
model_info <- tibble::tibble(
  Metric = c("LOO", "WAIC"),
  Value = c(loo_result$estimates["looic", "Estimate"], waic_result$estimates["waic", "Estimate"])
)

# Display model coefficients and diagnostics together
modelsummary(
  list("Bayesian Model" = bayesian_model, "Model Diagnostics" = model_info),
  statistic = c("mean", "sd", "conf.int"),
  conf_level = 0.95
)
Explanation
Parameter Statistics: modelsummary outputs posterior means and credible intervals, helping you see the model’s estimated effects.
LOO & WAIC: These metrics provide a Bayesian equivalent to AIC/BIC, helping assess model fit and predictive accuracy.
This approach allows you to compare parameter estimates alongside model diagnostics, helping assess both the quality of individual predictors and the overall fit of your Bayesian model.
